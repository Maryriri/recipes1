<!-- Unordered List (Bullet-point List) -->
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Add sausage to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir with a spatula, breaking apart the sausage until cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>

    <li>Whisk milk, water, and gravy mix together in the same saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the gravy reaches a boil and thickens, about 8 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in the crumbled sausage.</li>
    <li>Tear biscuits into pieces. Spread 1/2 of the biscuit pieces in an even layer in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour the sausage and gravy mixture over the biscuits. Place the remaining biscuit pieces evenly on top. Sprinkle the dried cranberries over the top.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the biscuits are golden, about 20 minutes.</li>
